# misaka_udl
Notepad++ UDL for the ukagaka SHIORI Misaka

This UDL provides simple syntax for Misaka. It focuses on highlighting event names, helping to distinguish parenthesis from curly braces, and dimming SakuraScript tags to make dialogue easier to read.

It's not perfect, but hopefully it helps!
